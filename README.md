This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the University of California, San Diego's Women in Computing's revamped website that was officially launched on September 29th, 2020.<br />
We decided to create our website from scratch the summer of 2020, and the finished result can be found here at wic.ucsd.edu.
We are continuously making changes to the site so be on the lookout for updates!

### `How to make changes to the site and deploy them correctly.`
1. Make changes locally. <br />
    git clone (if first time using) git pull if folder is already stored locally<br />
    npm install [to download node modules locally]<br />
    npm start [to view the website locally]<br />
    make whatever changes necessary<br />
2. npm run build [locally]
3. Push to github<br />
    git add .<br />
    git commit -m "commit message"<br />
    git push<br />
4. Ssh into the server.
5. Pull from the repo on the server (cd website 2020; git pull)
6. Copy current public_html to temp (cd ..; rm -rf temp; mv public_html temp)
7. Copy build from the website2020 to public_html (cp -r website2020/build public_html)
9. Check the website at wic.ucsd.edu to ensure all changes were made and uploaded successfully!

### `npm start`
How to view the website locally as you make changes.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

Since npm start has a lot of node modules and UCSD's server doesnâ€™t support node - only static pages - we have to do npm run build every time we make changes.
This step generates a build folder, generates a static version of everything, then creates an index.html folder that holds the information.
The index.html file is not that legible as it is simply one long line of code, but it makes things faster when building the website.
